I. Checkpoint Objective
At this checkpoint, you are asked to write an algorithm that read a sentence, which ends with a point, character by character, and to determine:

II. Instructions

  -The length of the sentence (the number of characters).
  -The number of words in the sentence (assuming that the words are separated by a single space).
  -The number of vowels in the sentence.

You have to keep in mind that:

  -Each character will be treated separately.
  -The last character is the point.
  -Use three variables as counters.


SOLUTION

0. Algo name "read_sentence"
1. Declaring seven variables:
  * sentence (the sentence to work on),
  * chars_nber, words_nber, vowels_nber (respectively the length of the sentence, the number of words in the sentence and the number of vowels in the sentence)
  * counter_1, counter_2, counter_3 (the three counters)
